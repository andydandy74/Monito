A view extension for the Dynamo visual programming environment. 

Still very much a work in progress.
Currently includes the following tools:
* Manage Dynamo Player Inputs
* Search in Workspace

## Instructions

* Build in Visual Studio
* Copy ```src/Monito_ViewExtensionDefinition.xml``` to ```C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\1.3\viewExtensions```
* Copy ```src/bin/Debug/Monito.dll``` to ```C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\1.3```
