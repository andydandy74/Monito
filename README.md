* Copy ```src/bin/Debug/Monito.dll``` to ```C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\1.3```
* Copy ```src/bin/Debug/Monito.dll.config``` to ```C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\1.3```
* After launching Dynamo you should see a new menu item ```DynaMonito```

## Instructions for Dynamo 2.x

* Build in Visual Studio from ```Dynamo_2.0.1``` branch
* Copy ```src/Monito_ViewExtensionDefinition.xml``` to ```C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\2\viewExtensions```
* Copy ```src/bin/Debug/Monito.dll``` to ```C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\2```
* Copy ```src/bin/Debug/Monito.dll.config``` to ```C:\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Core\2```
