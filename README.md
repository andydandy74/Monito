A view extension for the Dynamo visual programming environment. 

Still very much a work in progress.
Currently includes the following tools:
* Find and Fix Ungrouped
* Isolate in Geometry Preview
* Manage Dynamo Player Inputs (and Outputs - Dynamo 2.x only, though)
* My Graphs (quick access to graph directories)
* New Workspace from Template
* Package Directories
* Search in Workspace
